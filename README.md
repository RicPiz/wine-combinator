An interactive Streamlit application for discovering and recommending Italian wines based on color, price range, and food pairings. Data sourced from Vivino, focusing exclusively on Italian wines.

## Features

- **Wine Recommendations**: Filter wines by color (red/white), price range, and food pairings. Results are ranked by average rating, number of reviews, and proximity to your selected price range.
- **Visual Cards**: Each recommendation displays a bottle image, key details (rating, reviews, price), tasting notes, and structure metrics (light-structured, dry-sweet, flat-acidic).
- **Food Pairing**: Select from various food types (e.g., Beef, Pasta, Fish) to find matching wines.
- **Wineries Map**: Interactive map of Italy showing winery locations. Click on regions to view associated wines and details.
- **Downloadable Results**: Export your recommendations as a CSV file.
- **Responsive Design**: Grid layout for recommendations, custom styling for a polished look.

- **Images**: Bottle images are in `img_all/` directory, matched by normalized wine name and year.
- **Map Data**: GeoJSON and shapefiles in `Wine_Map/` for Italian regions and winery coordinates.
- **Disclaimer**: All data and images are obtained from [Vivino](https://www.vivino.com). This project uses only Italian wine information for educational purposes.

If an image isn't found, a placeholder is displayed.
